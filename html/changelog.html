				<li class="rscadd">Adds stingbangs to cargo (and one in the sec vendor premium), premium less-lethal grenades that shoot off a giant swarm of stingball pellets to help incapacitate swarms of people in tight quarters. You can jump on top of a live one to be a hero and absorb a bunch of shrapnel, same with  frag grenades. There's even an achievement for dying to a grenade you jumped on!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Projectiles can now embed in people! Or at least grenade shrapnel and the new .38 DumDum ammo, now available in cargo, can. DumDum rounds excel against unarmored targets, but are pricey and do poorly against armored targets.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bullets can now ricochet! Or at least, standard .38 and the new .38/L6 Match Grade ammo can. Match Grade ammo is finely tuned to ricochet easier and seek targets off bounces better, and can be purchased from cargo (for the .38) or nuke ops uplink (for the L6), but standard .38 ammo has a chance to ricochet as well.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Frag grenades now have smaller explosions but shoot off a bunch of devastating shrapnel, excellent for soft targets!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Shotguns and other multi-pellet guns now print aggregate messages, so you'll get one "You've been hit by 6 buckshot pellets!" rather than 6 "You've been hit by the buckshot pellet in the X!" messages. Bye bye lag!</li>
				<li class="balance">Armor can now protect against embedding weapons, taking the best of either the bullet or bomb armor for the limb in question away from the embed chance. Some weapons are better at piercing armor than others!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Due to pressure from various organizations, Nanotrasen is implementing a new ban on the purchase of alcohol and tobacco products for crewmembers under the age of 20 onboard its Spinward space stations. Please remember that providing alcohol or tobacco products to underage crewmembers is against Space Law, and remember to check those cards bartenders!</li>

				<li class="bugfix">DNA Consoles have had a firmware update. Mutations can once again be removed properly from the selection list of Advanced Injectors and chromosomes can be removed from storage in any order.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Chromosomes can now be added to all activated mutations on a test subject using the DNA Console instead of just the last activated mutation in the list.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Advanced Injectors no longer super-hyper-mega-ultra-expend themselves and will now only expend themselves once.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Genetic data from used Mutation Activators may now be too limited to extract a new chromosome at DNA Consoles.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Chromosomes now always insert themselves into DNA Consoles when created, unless the console storage buffer is full in which case the chromosome is left on top of the console.</li>
				<li class="tweak">There are now additional feedback messages during the chromosome creation process to keep the user informed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">DNA Consoles have had another firmware update. They are now able to accurately predict and output which chromosomes than an activated genetic mutation is compatible with.</li>
